# random-pw-generator
I followed the mock up almost exactly since i didn't want to mess with the starter code too much
but the password generator isn't too bad! It took some time to figure it out but overall it was 
a fun experience. By clicking the button to generate the password it gives you a randomized 
set of letters, numbers, ans special characters!
